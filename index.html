      On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness<br>
      By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages<br>
      Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone<br>
      And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      In your house, I long to be<br>
      Room by room, patiently<br>
      I'll wait for you there, like a stone<br>
      I'll wait for you there, alone<br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="important"> 
      And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels<br>
      Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven<br>
      To a place I recall, I was there so long ago<br>
      The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      In your house, I long to be<br>
      Room by room, patiently<br>
      I'll wait for you there, like a stone<br>
      I'll wait for you there, alone, alone<br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="important">
      And on I read, until the day was gone<br>
      And I sat in regret of all the things I've done<br>
      For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged<br>
      In dreams until my death, I will wander on<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      In your house, I long to be<br>
      Room by room, patiently<br>
      I'll wait for you there, like a stone<br>
      I'll wait for you there, alone, alone<br>
